## Features
This project is under development. The following is a subset of current features:
- A layer system enabling both tiles and images to be displayed on the map
- Tile editing system which enables any image to be partitioned into tiles
- Mixing of various tileset sizes, which enables granular (atomic!) control over the design of the map
- Hierarchical projects enabling maps, layers, and tilesets to be grouped
- Automated workspace saving and loading in order to quickly continue from when the application was closed.
- A configurable docking system which accomodates various layouts of the interface. Several docks are provided, including
    - Tile Editor - Partitions images into tiles and enables selection of the partitioned tiles
    - Layer List - Allows hierarchical managment of a map's layers
    - Minimap- Provides a simplified overview of the map
    - Clipboard - Stores various items and enables copying and pasting of selected items
